  cabal configure
  cabal build
  cabal install --user

should build two executables, fol2fol (the FOL optimizer) and
fol2haskell (the FOL to Haskell compiler), and install them to
$HOME/.cabal/bin, so that they become available from the command
line.  If you don't want to install them, you can find the
executables somewhere in the dist/ directory.

Assuming the executables are on the path,

  rake test

runs the self-test suite.
