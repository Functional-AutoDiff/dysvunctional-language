  cabal configure
  cabal build
  cabal install --user

should build two executables, fol2haskell (the FOL to Haskell
compiler), and fol2js (the FOL to Javascript compiler), and install
them to $HOME/.cabal/bin, so that they become available from the
command line.  If you don't want to install them, you can find the
executables somewhere in the dist/ directory.
