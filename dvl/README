A DVL interpreter and an aggressively optmizing DVL->Scheme compiler

Author: Alexey Radul


Why do you care?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This compiler supports a standard library that implements forward mode
AD, using gensyms to avoid perturbation confusion.  This compiler
performs union-free flow analysis augmented to understand the gensyms.
It is good enough that it migrates all the tagging, dispatching, and
other scaffolding of the AD implementation to compile time, leaving
efficient, unconfused code.


What is DVL?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

DysVunctional Language (DVL) is a variant of VL that adds support for
gensyms, a slight impurity (hence the name).  Gensyms are unique,
dynamically created objects each of which is guaranteed to be
distinguishable from all other objects.  This is interesting because
the gensym impurity is sufficent to implement forward mode AD in user
space without perturbation confusion, and yet is not so compilcated as
to be un-analyzable.

As a language, DVL differs from VL only in supporting one additional
data type, the gensym.  DVL also offers the following additional
procedures:

gensym      -- Creates and returns a fresh object
  This object is guaranteed to be distinct from all other objects.

gensym?     -- Tells whether an object was created by GENSYM.

gensym=     -- Tests whether two objects were created by the same
  dynamic call to GENSYM.

See also the DVL standard library.


So how does it work?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

DVL is a copy of the VL compiler (in fact, they share a respectable
quantity of code), except that it has been modified to process gensyms
properly.  Only the flow analysis and supporting structures needed
modification; in particular, the overall architecture, the syntax
phase, the code generator, and the post-processor are all the same.

DVL also comes with a nontrivial standard library.  Said library
implements forward mode AD by the generic operations method, with
explicit tagging of and dispatching on distinct perturbations.  It
relies on the flow analysis to specialize all that machinery to each
particular use case to produce efficient code.


I'm psyched!  Where do I start?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Have an idea of VL first.

TODO what's a good example program?

DVL differs implementationally from VL in two ways.  First, of course,
DVL supports gensyms.  This has consequences for the fundamental
abstract evaluation, and some of the supporting data structures.
Also, gensyms arrange refinement interdependencies in such a way that
using a round-robin strategy for incremental refinement is intolerably
slow, so the DVL abstract analysis loop is organized around a work
queue of expressions to abstractly evaluate in various environments.
This changes the supporting code around the essential abstract
evaluator, and the abstract analysis data structure.

Here are the files and ways where DVL differs materially from VL:

abstract-eval.scm     New abstract evaluator; work-queue analysis loop
stdlib.dvl            Standard library implementing forward AD [*]
primitives.scm        New gensym primitives; abstract evaluation support
analysis.scm          Support for the work queue
abstract-values.scm   Support for gensyms
eval.scm              Concrete evaluator with gensym support
data.scm              Support for gensyms

If you run diff you will also discover some small incidental
discrepancies.  TODO Remove these?

[*] TODO See also load.scm for interface hackery

These are the files that DVL shares with VL:

macro.scm
letrec.scm
syntax.scm
read.scm
env.scm
nomenclature.scm
code-generator.scm

DVL, like VL, also relies on the FOL compiler in ../vl/fol/, which see.
