Rewrite examples using internal definitions?

Eliminate tests VL cannot pass (e.g. by searching for *j in the test
program in tool/test-driver-scm.scm)

Make VL a "complete" VLAD implementation

Write about VL in the VLAD language manual

Make VL releasable

Better mappings between the source program, esp. names, and the
generated code (presumably via the analysis)

Tracing concrete evaluator that checks that the analysis was right
